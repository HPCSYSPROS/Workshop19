# Chameleon: How to Build a Cloud++

**Keynote Speaker:** 
Kate Keahey, Argonne National Laboratory

**Abstract:**
Chameleon is a large-scale, deeply reconfigurable experimental platform built to support Computer Sciences systems research. Community projects range from systems research developing exascale operating systems, virtualization methods, performance variability studies, and power management research to projects in software defined networking, machine learning, and resource management. What makes Chameleon unique is that it provides these sophisticated capabilities based on a mainstream infrastructure cloud system (OpenStack). In this talk, I will explain the challenges we faced in building Chameleon, lessons learned, operations experiences, and describe our packaging of the system that integrates both the developed capabilities and the operational experience and facilitates managing platforms of this kind.
