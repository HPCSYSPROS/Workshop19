**Abstract:**
High performance computing is highly dependent on validated, tested environments that are tuned for specific hardware to yield good performance. Spack enables users to construct their own software stacks, but does not provide the benefits of a centrally curated environment. We implemented new features in Spack to support co-existing, system-wide deployments and user Spack environments, as well as a Spackenabled global environment with these. This improved the global environmentâ€™s portability and the efficiency of Spack use on a production system.
